## NOTE: This project is no loonger being maintained.

## Summary
This is Diepchat, a chatting service for the browser game [diep.io](https://diep.io). You can
end messages to other people that are in the same server. For example, if one person is in
sandbox and another person is in 4 teams, they wont be able to see each others messages. If
there are two people in sandbox, one person in 4 teams and one of the people in the sandbox
sends a message, the person in the 4 teams server won't get it. There are also commands. If
you try to send a message with the content "!help", you would get info on what commands there
are and how to use them. I will add more to this at a later date.


## Todo:
- [X] add client side commands
- [X] add a command that outputs everyone who is in your server and using diepchat
- [X] fix my domain
- [ ] make the users of my script's name turn green
- [ ] proxy port 8080 to diepchat.xyz/chat
